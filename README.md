# Algorithm: Develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

# Prompt-Based Task Organizer

## Objective
Create a prompt-based task organizer using ChatGPT to manage daily tasks effectively.

---

## Algorithm

### 1. Identify the Objective
Develop a prompt-based application that uses large language model capabilities (ChatGPT) to help users manage and organize their daily tasks.

---

### 2. Design Basic Prompts
Create simple prompts to list daily tasks.

- **Example Prompt:**  
  `"List today’s tasks under categories: Work, Study, Personal."`

---

### 3. Enhance with Intermediate Features
Add more intelligent structuring and scheduling.

- **Prioritization Prompt:**  
  `"Sort today’s tasks by urgency and importance."`

- **Scheduling Prompt:**  
  `"Suggest a time slot for each task based on a 9–5 schedule."`

---

### 4. Integrate Advanced Capabilities
Make the organizer more context-aware and dynamic.

- **Smart Recommendations:**  
  `"Based on yesterday’s pending tasks, suggest a revised schedule."`

- **Contextual Awareness Prompt:**  
  `"If it's a holiday, shift non-urgent tasks to tomorrow."`

---

### 5. Test the Prompt Flow
- Simulate different daily scenarios:
  - Weekend
  - Exam day
  - Busy weekday
- Validate outputs based on context changes.

---

### 6. Iterate and Optimize
- Refine prompts to make them more concise and relevant.
- Ensure clarity and logical consistency in the model's outputs.

---

## Sample Prompts and Outputs

### Prompt 1:
**Input:**  
`"List my tasks for today under Work, Study, and Personal."`

**Output:**


Prompt 3:
“I missed yesterday’s workout and report. Update today’s plan.”
Output:

9:00 AM – Team meeting

10:00 AM – Finish yesterday’s report

12:00 PM – Workout (missed)

2:00 PM – Revise C programming

4:00 PM – Embedded systems lecture

5:00 PM – Call family
